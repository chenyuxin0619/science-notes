<h4>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Decentralised finance (DeFi) has emerged as a potential substitute for traditional financial institutions, offering peer-to-peer transactions and a diverse range of services that democratise finance by enabling users to participate in protocol governance. However, several studies have suggested that the current governance mechanisms require improvements. This article provides an overview of findings associated with DeFi governance.</p>

<h4>Centralisation of Governance in DeFi Protocols<a class="headerlink" href="#centralisation-of-governance-in-defi-protocols" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Lending Protocols</strong></p>
<p>Lending Protocols are DeFi applications built on top of blockchain technology that allow users to lend and borrow cryptocurrency assets without the need for intermediaries such as banks or traditional financial institutions.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Decentralized Exchanges</strong></p>
<p>Decentralized Exchanges (DeXs) are peer-to-peer trading platforms built on top of a blockchain that enable the direct exchange of cryptocurrency assets without the need for a central authority or intermediary.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Yield Aggregator</strong></p>
<p>Yield Aggregator are DeFi applications that automate the process of seeking out the best yield opportunities for cryptocurrency assets, and provide users with a way to optimize their returns on investment.</p>
</aside>
<p>Centralisation in DeFi has become a growing concern among researchers with several studies identifying a significant level of centrality in the governance mechanisms of DeFi protocol. Barbereau et al., <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id31" title="Tom Barbereau, Reilly Smethurst, Orestis Papageorgiou, Alexander Rieger, and Gilbert Fridgen. Defi, not so decentralized: the measured distribution of voting rights. Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), 2022.">BSP+22a</a>]</span> found that the decentralisation of voting is significantly low with a majority of the voting power concentrated among a percentage of governance token holders. As evidenced by their findings, there was a significant degree of centrality, in lending protocols, decentralisd exchanges and yield aggregators. This research work employed case studies to comprehend the governance mechanisms of these protocols.</p>
<p>Similarly, result by Jensen et al. <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id30" title="Johannes Rude Jensen, Victor von Wachter, and Omri Ross. How decentralized is the governance of blockchain-based finance: empirical evidence from four governance token distributions. arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.10096, 2021.">JvWR21</a>]</span> demonstrate centrality in voting power with the protocols top 5, top 100, and top 1000 wallet addresses controlling majority of the voting power in Balancer, Compound, Uniswap and Yearn Finance protocols. In this study, the token holdings and users’ wallets of protocols were analysed; Compound displayed the most evidence of centrality and Uniswap the least with the top 5 wallet addresses accounting for 42.1% and 12.05%, respectively.</p>
<p>Barbereau et al. <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id28" title="Tom Barbereau, Reilly Smethurst, Orestis Papageorgiou, Johannes Sedlmeir, and Gilbert Fridgen.

<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Voter Collusion</strong></p>
<p>Voter Collusion refers to a situation where a group of voters collude together to manipulate the outcome of a voting process in their favor, typically by coordinating their votes to create a super majority.</p>

The bond voting mechanism issues ‘voting bonds’ to voters, which essentially requires a commitment to stake an amount of tokens, for a time period to gain voting power. Therefore, by combining this time commitment with weighed voting with a time commitment, sybil attacks are more difficult. Quadratic voting, another solution to voting concentration, allows participants to convey both their preferences and the intensity of those preferences, however, the drawback of this mechanism is its vulnerability to sybil attacks, voter collusion and voter fraud <span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id36" title="Aggelos Kiayias and Philip Lazos.

<h4>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The vision of DeFi is to foster a democratic process of governance and sustain high levels of decentralisation. However, recent studies have highlighted significant centrality in DeFi governance mechanisms, indicating the need for improvements in the existing governance models. The studies analysed in this article have revealed that the majority of the voting power in several protocols is concentrated among the top token holders, with evidence of increasing centralisation over time. Moreover, DeFi has been found to face challenges in the voting and governance process. In view of some of these challenges, researchers have proposed novel solutions such as a bond voting and an AI-enabled parameter-selection solution to improve the current mechanisms. Given the importance of decentralisation in the underlying philosophy of DeFi, proposing more solutions to governance challenges is crucial for creating a more inclusive and democratic financial ecosystem. Therefore, continued research and development will certainly be required.</p>

<h4>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Blockchain technology has been lauded for its potential to disrupt various industries, given its unique properties such as decentralisation, transparency, and security. One recent advancement in this area is the development of blockchain bridges, which enable interoperability among different blockchains. Bridges facilitate communication between two blockchain ecosystems through the transfer of assets and information. However, as with any innovative technology, these bridges pose new security challenges. In this science note, we delve into the current academic landscape surrounding the security of blockchain bridges and summarise the recent research findings.</p>

<h4>Interoperability and Security Challenges<a class="headerlink" href="#interoperability-and-security-challenges" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs</strong></p>
<p>A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic technique that enables one party, the prover, to convince another party, the verifier, of the validity of a statement or the possession of a secret without revealing any additional information about the underlying secret or data.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>zk-SNARK</strong></p>
<p>Zk-SNARK is an acronym that stands for “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”. A zk-SNARK is a cryptographic proof that allows one party to prove it possesses certain information without revealing that information.</p>
</aside>
<p>Interoperability in blockchain environments brings forth a series of unique security challenges. Trustless, interoperable, cryptocurrency-backed assets can be subjected to various threats. In April 2022, attackers were able to obtain five of the nine validator keys, through which they stole 624 million USD by exploiting the Ronin bridge, making it the largest attack in the history of DeFi <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id101" title="Sam Kessler and Sage D.

According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, until August 2022 recurring attacks against bridges have cost users around 1.4 billion USD <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id100" title="Ryan Browne. Hackers have stolen $1.4 billion this year using crypto bridges. here’s why it’s happening, cnbc. CNBC, 2022.

In 2022 attacks on bridges accounted for 69% of total funds stolen <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id88" title="ChainAnalysis.

<p>This necessitates the development of novel security models and protocols to protect against potential attack vectors arising from cross-chain communication and is particularly true for blockchain bridges that need to uphold the integrity and security of transactions across disparate networks. Most existing solutions rely on the trust assumptions of committees, which lowers security significantly.</p>
<p>Xie et al. <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id97" title="Tiancheng Xie, Jiaheng Zhang, Zerui Cheng, Fan Zhang, Yupeng Zhang, Yongzheng Jia, Dan Boneh, and Dawn Song.

The main idea is to leverage zk-SNARK, which are succinct non-interactive proofs (arguments) of knowledge as a result security is ensured without relying on a committee. zkBridge uses the zk-SNARK protocol to achieve both reasonable proof generation times and on-chain verification costs. zkBridge is trustless as it does not require extra assumptions other than those of blockchains and underlying cryptographic protocols. It is the first to use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to enable a decentralised trustless bridge.</p>

The framework aids in identifying crucial assumptions and characteristics, mitigating security risks, enhancing the decision-making process, and minimising design mistakes and performance issues. It recognises the integration system as the fundamental unit of cross-blockchain technology, providing comprehensive analysis and addressing security concerns. Moreover, the framework supports businesses in designing and integrating various blockchain applications, while enabling a more accurate evaluation of security assumptions. Thus, it paves the way for effective interoperability among multiple blockchains.</p>

<h4>The Role of Cryptography in Blockchain Bridge Security<a class="headerlink" href="#the-role-of-cryptography-in-blockchain-bridge-security" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Sidechain</strong></p>
<p>A sidechain is a blockchain that communicates with other blockchains via a two-way peg. It stems from the main blockchain and runs in parallel to it.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Cryptographic Protocol</strong></p>
<p>A cryptographic protocol is an abstract or concrete protocol that performs a security-related function and applies cryptographic methods, often as sequences of cryptographic primitives. A protocol describes how the algorithms should be used and includes details about data structures and representations, at which point it can be used to implement multiple, interoperable versions of a programme.</p>
</aside>
<p>Securing blockchain bridges is greatly dependent on the strength of the cryptographic techniques deployed. The fundamental study by Kiayias et al. <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id91" title="Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russell, Bernardo David, and Roman Oliynykov. Ouroboros: a provably secure proof-of-stake blockchain protocol.

Springer, 2017.">KRDO17</a>]</span> on proof-of-stake blockchain protocols is of significant relevance. They outlined a novel cryptographic mechanism that provides transactional security while ensuring transparency.</p>
<p>To mitigate the reliance on external trust assumptions, Li et al. <span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id92" title="Taotao Li, Changlin Yang, Qinglin Yang, Siqi Zhou, Huawei Huang, and Zibin Zheng.

The security of the Hash time-lock scheme is based on cryptographic hardness assumptions. The asset receiver is forced to determine the collection and produce proof of collection to the payer within the cut-off time, or the asset will be returned via hash-locks and blockchain time-locks. The proof of receipt can be used by the payer to acquire assets of equal value on the recipient’s blockchain or trigger other events. However, this scheme only supports monetary exchange and thus has low scalability.</p>

In particular, the two-way peg is a mechanism that allows bidirectional communication between blockchains. An example of a two-way peg is simplified payment verification (SPV) in Bitcoin. Relays represent a mechanism that enables a blockchain network to authenticate data from other blockchain networks, eliminating the need for external third-party sources.

These protocols function through smart contracts, achieving a “consensus on top of consensus” that avoids changes to the blockchains’ consensus layers. TrustBoost operates by allowing cross-chain communication via bridges, facilitating the sharing of information across smart contracts on different blockchains. This system maintains its security as long as two-thirds of the participating blockchains are secure. Furthermore, TrustBoost shows potential in mitigating risks associated with cross-chain token transfers and exhibits promising prospects for future applications, especially as heterogeneous blockchain networks continue to mature.</p>

<h4>Rationale Behind Mobile Theft Prevention using Blockchain<a class="headerlink" href="#rationale-behind-mobile-theft-prevention-using-blockchain" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Mobile theft has become a growing concern for individuals and organizations around the world. In addition to the financial loss associated with the theft, there is also a significant risk of personal data being compromised. The use of blockchain technology for mobile theft prevention offers a secure and efficient solution for preventing mobile theft <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id19" title="Andreas Göbel. Using blockchain to prevent mobile phone theft. Camelot, 2018. URL: https://blog.camelot-group.com/2018/12/using-blockchain-to-prevent-mobile-phone-theft/.">Gob18</a>]</span>. This technology can help individuals and organizations protect their mobile devices and personal information by providing a decentralized and tamper-proof way to track and block stolen mobile devices. By using private blockchains, the proposed model can be implemented in a way that ensures security and privacy, while also reducing the risk of fraud or malicious activity.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Decentralized and tamper-proof:</strong> Blockchain technology enables a decentralized and tamper-proof system for tracking and disabling stolen mobile devices. This ensures that the information stored on the blockchain is accurate and cannot be tampered with, making it a reliable source for tracking stolen devices <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id20" title="Chirag. Blockchain: the technology revolutionizing mobile app security. Appinventive, 2023. URL: https://appinventiv.com/blog/blockchain-technology-revolutionizing-mobile-app-security/.">Chi23</a>]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure and private:</strong> The proposed model uses a private blockchain network that connects the mobile manufacturing companies and their nodes <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id21" title="Gwyneth Iredale. The rise of private blockchain technologies. 101 Blockchains, 2021. URL: https://101blockchains.com/private-blockchain/.">Ire21</a>]</span>. This helps to ensure the security of the network and the data stored in it, and also helps to maintain the privacy of the users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Automation of process:</strong> Smart contracts can be programmed to automatically disable the device once the signal is sent, reducing human error and increasing the efficiency <span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id22" title="Utpal Biswas Debashis Das, Sourav Banerjee. A secure vehicle theft detection framework using blockchain and smart contract. Springer, 2021. URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12083-020-01022-0.">DD21</a>]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cross-border usage:</strong> The proposed model can be used in cross-border cases, making it more efficient and effective than existing methods <span id="id8">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id23" title="Murali Ramakrishnan. How blockchain works in cross-border payments. Springer, 2021. URL: https://blogs.oracle.com/financialservices/post/how-blockchain-works-in-cross-border-payments-.">Ram21</a>]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cost reduction:</strong> By reducing the number of mobile thefts, the proposed model can also have a positive economic impact. This can include reducing the costs associated with mobile theft for consumers, mobile carriers, and insurance companies <span id="id9">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id24" title="Ahmed Ali.

<h4>Alternative Technologies Available under Development<a class="headerlink" href="#alternative-technologies-available-under-development" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>IMEI blocking:</strong> One of the most common methods for preventing mobile theft is to block the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number of a stolen device. This can be done by reporting the theft to the mobile carrier, who will then blacklist the IMEI number and prevent the device from connecting to the network <span id="id10">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id25" title="Jacob Hicks.

</ul>
<p>In comparison, the model of using blockchain for mobile theft prevention offers several potential advantages over these existing methods. A decentralized and tamper-proof system for tracking and disabling stolen devices, and the smart contract can be programmed to automatically disable the device once the signal is sent, reducing human error and increasing the efficiency. Additionally, the proposed model can potentially work in cross-border cases, which is not possible with IMEI and SIM card blocking, and also can be integrated with other theft prevention methods.</p>
</section>
<section id="methodology">
<h4>Methodology<a class="headerlink" href="#methodology" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The smart contract enables the registration of new mobile devices and maps them to their respective phone numbers. This allows users to update the status of their mobile devices on the blockchain, indicating whether they are lost or stolen. The smart contract also allows for changes to be made to the registered mobile devices’ information, such as their International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, and to update the corresponding phone number. In this way, the smart contract provides a secure and tamper-proof solution for tracking the status of mobile devices on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The mobile application is designed to constantly monitor the state of the mobile device by making API calls to the blockchain. If the blockchain indicates that the device has been reported stolen, the application takes action by disabling the device’s Wi-Fi and network connections and forcing it into airplane mode. By doing so, the application prevents the thief from using any of the phone’s features, rendering it useless until it can be recovered by the rightful owner.</p>
<p>When a mobile phone is marked as stolen on the blockchain through the smart contract and later found, the owner can connect it to a computer via USB and use USB mode to provide data to the phone. This allows the owner to activate the phone again by providing the data through the USB based hotspot.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/yathin017/ec50576dcd706e5868f4d96edcd5a00c">smart contract</a> is written in both Solidity and JavaScript programming languages that can be deployed on a blockchain network. It is designed to prevent mobile theft by using a mapping function to keep track of mobile devices using their IMEI numbers and phone numbers.</p>
<p>The smart contract consists of six functions that can be called by authorized users.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">addIMEI()</span></code>  allows users to add their mobile devices to the blockchain by passing in their IMEI and phone numbers. The function first checks if the IMEI and phone numbers already exist on the blockchain, and if not, it adds the device to the mapping function.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">activateLost()</span></code>  is used to activate the lost mode of a mobile device. The function checks if the IMEI number of the device exists on the blockchain and if it does, it sets the value of  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isIMEIlost</span></code> to true, indicating that the device is lost.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">deactivateLost()</span></code> is used to deactivate the lost mode of a mobile device. The function checks if the IMEI number of the device exists on the blockchain and if it does, it sets the value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isIMEIlost</span></code> to false, indicating that the device is no longer lost.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">changeIMEI()</span></code> allows users to change the IMEI number of their device. The function checks if the old IMEI and phone number exists on the blockchain and if it does, it replaces the old IMEI with the new one.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">changePhoneNumber()</span></code> allows users to change the phone number associated with their device. The function checks if the old IMEI and phone number exists on the blockchain and if it does, it replaces the old phone number with the new one.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">checkIMEI()</span></code> is a view function that allows anyone to check if a particular device is lost by passing in the IMEI number of the device. The function returns true if the device is lost, and false if it is not.</p></li>

<h4>A Background Story<a class="headerlink" href="#a-background-story" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Some months ago, a friend of mine working in the sales department of a major European bank told me about a chaotic experience he had with a potential client. The client was a cryptocurrency miner who had invested in a warehouse in Switzerland and filled it with state-of-the-art computers for mining. The business was thriving, and with the cryptocurrency boom, it was yielding good profits. However, some weather events, like a hailstorm, had caused heavy damage to his equipment.</p>
<p>The miner contacted my friend to inquire about insurance protection against such weather events. My friend saw the opportunity and approached the relevant departments in his bank, including bank insurance and product design. That’s where the story ended. My friend spent countless meetings and days explaining the basics to our colleagues: what a miner does, their work, and their business. Even escalations to top management were in vain. In the meantime, the miner found an alternative financial solution provided by a cutting-edge FinTech, and as a result, both he and his bank lost an outstanding prospective customer. Preventing this missed business opportunities from happening again in legacy banks is the subject of this article.</p>

<section id="introduction">
<h4>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Cryptocurrencies present unique challenges for legacy financial institutions from both internal and external viewpoints. Internally, these institutions must explore how to integrate cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technologies into their existing systems, leveraging the technology to embrace a new era of financial management. This internal perspective significantly impacts processes and IT infrastructure and also has implications for costs and IT investments, from a financial statement standpoint.</p>
<p>Externally, the presence of institutional and retail cryptocurrency customers (e.g., cryptocurrency platforms or cryptocurrency holders) creates a conundrum. This demands meticulous attention to regulatory compliance, risk management, and product offerings within the existing framework, which aim to discover innovative revenue streams beyond traditional avenues. Indeed, from a financial statement perspective, this external view could have a significant impact on revenues, allowing a diversification strategy.</p>
<div class="info admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Internal Perspective</p>
<p>Legacy banks face the challenge of integrating cryptocurrencies into their traditional banking systems, which involves exploring ways to leverage blockchain technology, decentralization, and secure transactions. By effectively integrating these digital assets, legacy banks can tap into the potential of cryptocurrencies and offer innovative financial services to their customers.</p>

<h4>Managing Crypto Customers<a class="headerlink" href="#managing-crypto-customers" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Legacy banks encounter a unique set of challenges when engaging with crypto customers <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id93" title="European Central Bank. Crypto-assets: a new standard for banks. European Central Bank, 2023.

Relationship managers and salespeople must navigate the complexities of regulatory compliance, such as Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, to ensure adherence while facilitating a seamless customer experience. Additionally, concerns related to environmental sustainability and energy consumption associated with cryptocurrencies need to be addressed, providing clarity on the bank’s stance regarding these issues.</p>
<p>Legacy banks often miss out on business opportunities due to the interplay of regulatory, organizational, process, delivery, and employee bias constraints. To overcome these constraints and expand their business opportunities, legacy banks must adopt a proactive and reactive approach by focusing on setting up new central organizational structures within their general management organization. These new structures have responsibilities to provide clear provisions (both from credit risk and reputation risk management), Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and product management strategies exclusively dedicated to managing cryptocurrencies and serving crypto customers.</p>
<p>By proactively tackling both internal and external challenges, legacy financial institutions can begin to adeptly navigate the rapidly shifting landscape of cryptocurrency. In this article, we delve into a variety of innovative strategies and approaches that could be harnessed to tap into the vast potential of cryptocurrencies. A profound paradigm shift, altering how legacy banks engage with and manage cryptocurrencies, is indeed a pressing necessity in today’s digital era.</p>

<section id="assessing-regulatory-and-compliance-considerations">
<h4>Assessing Regulatory and Compliance Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#assessing-regulatory-and-compliance-considerations" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Engaging with crypto customers entails navigating through stringent regulatory obligations, such as AML and KYC regulations. Relationship managers and salespersons must ensure effective compliance with these regulations while also addressing concerns regarding environmental sustainability, given the energy-intensive nature of certain cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Given that these professionals receive no support from other organizational structures within their banking or financial institution, the burden of responsibility rests squarely on their shoulders. The breadth of their tasks is considerable, presenting a complex landscape that must be navigated independently.</p>
<p>To illustrate this from an operational standpoint, these individuals must personally interpret and apply relevant legal constraints due to a lack of cryptocurrency regulatory knowledge amongst legal professionals in traditional banks. Beyond this, they must design and implement a profitable pricing strategy that gains management approval, a task often involving numerous meetings, complex analyses, and financial simulations.</p>
<p>Moreover, they must fulfill climate, anti-money laundering, and privacy assessments, which are lengthy, complex, and mandatory in the credit process <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id95" title="European Union. Directive of the european parliament. European Union, 2018. URL: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF.">Uni18a</a>]</span>. All these activities are required to be performed simultaneously and swiftly to maintain a positive commercial relationship with customers, and analyze competitors’ actions. A chaotic, complex, and overwhelming task without help!</p>
<p>A more constructive approach has been lacking mainly due to the two major reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Banks employees’ biases and a negative approach towards cryptos</p></li>
<li><p>Unclear regulation about cryptos.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On the latter, the EU has been working on regulating cryptocurrencies to address potential risks and ensure consumer protection. While there is no specific comprehensive regulation for crypto management in banks, the following regulations may be relevant:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>MiCAR (Market in Crypto-Assets Regulation) <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id96" title="European Commission. Regulation of the european parliament and of the council. European Commission, 2020. URL: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0593.">Com20</a>]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD) <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id98" title="European Union. Anti-money laundering directive. European Union, 2015. URL: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32015L0849.">Uni15</a>]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id99" title="European Union. Markets in financial instruments regulation (mifir). European Union, 2014. URL: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/markets-in-financial-instruments-regulation-mifir.html.">Uni14</a>]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>EU General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679, “GDPR”) <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id97" title="European Union. General data protection regulation. European Union, 2018. URL: https://gdpr-info.eu.">Uni18b</a>]</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>From the perspective of a middle-aged EU bank employee, these regulations fail to provide a clear and straightforward framework. Instead, they offer only basic principles and contribute to the overwhelming amount of documentation that banks must manage within the European Union. Essentially, this situation becomes a burden, leading to additional costs without generating any significant increase in revenue. We will explore some potential solutions to these problems next.</p>

<section id="expanding-business-opportunities">
<h4>Expanding Business Opportunities<a class="headerlink" href="#expanding-business-opportunities" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Relationship managers and salespersons of legacy banks usually miss out on significant business opportunities due to the interplay of the regulatory, organizational, process, delivery, and employee biases constraints. To overcome these limitations, again, a paradigm shift is needed. Instead of treating crypto customers as a challenging prospect, the entire organization should embrace a proactive and reactive approach, which means setting up enabling factors for allowing the onboarding of crypto customers. These enabling factors entail creating central organizational structures within the bank that specialize in crypto management, encompassing risk management, AML, privacy, and product creation and offerings.</p>

<section id="establishing-centralized-organizational-structures">
<h4>Establishing Centralized Organizational Structures<a class="headerlink" href="#establishing-centralized-organizational-structures" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Central organizational structures dedicated to managing cryptocurrencies need to be set up from scratch because they can provide the necessary focus and guidance, encompassing both business and technical perspectives. These entities should establish clear provisions, mapping opportunities and risks, setting up and monitoring KPIs and product management strategies.</p>
<p>By assigning specific responsibilities and clearly structured activities, legacy banks can effectively identify and serve the right crypto customers, while ensuring compliance and risk mitigation and disregarding crypto customers that do not respect the bank provisions (e. g. crypto customers that do not have data privacy IT servers within a certain list of countries, or crypto customers that have some previous criminal records in terms of money laundering). Furthermore, offering tailored financial products, such as financing and insurance solutions, can enhance the profitability of the legacy institution. These bespoke products can be imagined only from employees who are engaged and motivated in the crypto world. Here are some examples of innovative crypto products that legacy banks could sell to crypto customers:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Crypto Mining Equipment Insurance: Develop insurance policies specifically designed to cover the risks associated with crypto mining equipment, such as physical risks (e.g., flood, hailstorm, theft, damage, or breakdown. This type of coverage would provide financial protection for miners who invest heavily in hardware</p></li>
<li><p>Crypto Hedging Insurance: Develop insurance policies specifically designed to cover the risks of extreme price volatility. This type of coverage would provide financial protection for crypto holders against price volatility</p></li>
<li><p>Operative Risks Insurance: Offer insurance policies that cover losses resulting from smart contract vulnerabilities, coding errors, fraudulent or failed transactions. This coverage could offer reimbursement for lost funds due to transaction errors, technical glitches, or fraudulent activities.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="talent-acquisition-and-skill-development">
<h4>Talent Acquisition and Skill Development<a class="headerlink" href="#talent-acquisition-and-skill-development" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Overcoming biases and improving crypto risk management within legacy banks may require attracting talent from outside the financial industry. Re-skilling and up-skilling existing employees may not be sufficient; therefore, individuals with fresh perspectives and expertise, especially those from product design and development will be required. This transformation process should focus on developing a workforce with the necessary skills to navigate the complexities of cryptocurrencies and related financial services.</p>
<p>In the general context, and simplifying it to the utmost, within legacy banks there are now individuals who possess extensive expertise in accounting, credit risk and loan origination, as well as classical IT knowledge related to applications managing transactions and data. The skills that are lacking to integrate an active and proactive understanding of cryptocurrencies pertain to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Advanced and cutting-edge programming languages</p></li>
<li><p>An eclectic and end-to-end vision of innovation (currently, innovation departments in legacy banks only focus on processes and costs rather than revenues and products)</p></li>
<li><p>Proficiency in designing new products that are completely different from the traditional ones.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="conclusion">
<h4>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Legacy financial institutions must proactively address the challenges associated with managing crypto customers. By navigating regulatory considerations, expanding business opportunities, establishing central organizations, and attracting specialized talent, these institutions can unlock the potential of cryptocurrencies within their existing frameworks. Embracing this transformation will not only help overcome the constraints imposed by regulation and biases but will also position the institutions at the forefront of the evolving financial landscape.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Key Insights</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sharding is a promising scaling technique for blockchains, dividing the network into smaller partitions called shards to process transactions in parallel, thus increasing throughput.</p></li>
<li><p>Sharding approaches in blockchain systems vary, with solutions like Ethereum 2.0 using multiple shard chains coordinated by a beacon chain, and others, such as Near Protocol’s Nightshade, opting for processing data chunks in a single blockchain with different validator sets.</p></li>
<li><p>Sharding implementation faces challenges in security, cross-shard communication, and data availability. These require solutions like random validator assignment, transaction receipts, and erasure coding.</p></li>
<li><p>While sharding offers potential scalability improvements, layer 2 solutions like ZK-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups remain the preferred short-term scaling methods until sharding proves its ability to handle high transaction volumes.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As the adoption of blockchain technology increases, scalability remains the central challenge and a major obstacle for blockchain to be adopted by mainstream industries. Bitcoin can only process 7 transactions per second (TPS), while the Ethereum blockchain can only process 15 TPS. Although after the Merge of Ethereum 1.0 into Ethereum 2.0, the TPS of Ethereum 2.0 is expected to reach 100,000 TPS, gas fees remain a major issue. Ethereum has been relying on ZK-rollups to scale the network, but rollups are only a short-term solution because of interoperability issues with other blockchains since they are mainly Ethereum-focussed. Therefore, the blockchain community is actively looking for a solution to the scalability problem.</p>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>ZK-Rollups</strong></p>
<p>ZK-Rollups in Ethereum are a Layer 2 scaling solution that uses zero-knowledge proofs to bundle multiple transactions into a single proof on the main chain. This reduces on-chain data storage and gas costs while maintaining security. As a result, ZK-Rollups enable higher throughput, lower fees, and faster confirmations for Ethereum transactions while preserving privacy and decentralization.</p>

<section id="what-is-sharding">
<h4>What is Sharding?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-sharding" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Sharding, originally a database design principle, is now being considered a promising solution to overcome the scalability challenges of blockchain systems. This scaling technique divides the blockchain network into smaller partitions called shards, each responsible for processing a subset of transactions. This allows the blockchain to process more transactions in parallel, thereby increasing the throughput of the system.</p>
<p>There are 2 common techniques blockchains implement to improve throughput:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Delegate all the computation to a small set of powerful nodes; (e.g., Algorand, Solana)</p></li>
<li><p>Each node in the network only does a subset of the total work (Sharding). Ethereum, <a class="reference external" href="https://near.org/">Near</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://hedera.com/">Hedera</a> use this technique.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p><strong>Sharding in Blockchains vs Traditional Databases</strong></p>
<p>The sharding techniques used in traditional databases cannot be directly applied to blockchains because of the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Blockchains rely on Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols which have been shown to be a scalability bottleneck.</p></li>
<li><p>Distributed databases depend on highly available transaction coordinators for atomicity and isolation assurance; however, blockchain coordinators could exhibit malicious behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>In a distributed database, any node can belong to any shard, but a blockchain must assign nodes to shards in a secure manner to ensure that no shard can be compromised by the attacker.</p></li>

<h5>Sharding in Ethereum<a class="headerlink" href="#sharding-in-ethereum" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h5>
<p>In Ethereum, data is distributed among several “shard chains” ([<a class="reference internal" href="#sharding-eth-near"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6</span></a>]). Each of these shard chains submits a record of transactions to the “beacon chain” or “coordinating layer”, which coordinates and manages the shards by maintaining synchronization and ensuring a common ledger. The shards receive sets of transactions from the mempool. Under the Ethereum 2.0 proposal, these TX are split based on their transaction types: Token transfers and Smart contract interactions. Validators then use an EVM to process shards’ data into a block and update the Merkle tree’s state on the beacon chain <span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id67" title="Alexander Kudzin, Kentaroh Toyoda, Satoshi Takayama, and Atsushi Ishigame.

<section id="sharding-in-near-blockchain">
<h5>Sharding in Near Blockchain<a class="headerlink" href="#sharding-in-near-blockchain" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h5>
<p>Near’s sharding technique is called “Nightshade” <span id="id8">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id65" title="Near. Near nightshade whitepaper. Near, 2020. URL: https://near.org/papers/nightshade/.">Nea20a</a>]</span>. Although the full implementation is still in progress, the idea is that instead of having multiple subchains with a single beacon chain, the data is divided into smaller partitions called chunks. Each chunk is processed by a different set of validators. The validators are randomly assigned to chunks, and the assignment is done in a way that the same validator is not assigned to multiple chunks, as shown in [<a class="reference internal" href="#sharding-eth-near"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6</span></a>]. At present, the Near blockchain has 4 shards, and the eventual plan is to have 100 shards {cite}`near roadmap.</p>

<section id="sharding-challenges">
<h4>Sharding Challenges<a class="headerlink" href="#sharding-challenges" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The main issue with sharding is that it is extremely complicated to implement, as it opens up possibilities of new attack vectors and security challenges. The following are some of the challenges that need to be addressed before sharding can be implemented in a blockchain system.</p>
<section id="security">
<h5>Security<a class="headerlink" href="#security" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h5>
<p>In a 10-shard system, each shard’s security is reduced by a factor of 10 due to separate validator sets. Upon hard-forking a non-sharded chain with X validators into a sharded chain, each shard has X/10 validators. Consequently, compromising one shard necessitates corrupting only 5.1% (51% / 10) of the total validators. This is a significant reduction in security. To overcome this challenge, Ethereum uses a beacon chain to randomly assign validators to shards. Blockchains like Near and Algorand use Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) to assign validators to shards. This ensures that the validators are randomly assigned to shards and the same validator is not assigned to multiple shards.</p>
<p>Hafid et al. <span id="id9">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id70" title="Abdelatif Hafid, Abdelhakim Senhaji Hafid, and Mustapha Samih. A tractable probabilistic approach to analyze sybil attacks in sharding-based blockchain protocols. IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, 2022.">HHS22</a>]</span> propose a Probabilistic Generating Function Analysis (PGFA) approach as an effective and tractable method to analyze the security of sharding-based blockchain protocols. They conclude that an increase in the number of Sybil IDs (unique nodes), network size, and ID Selection Pool (random pool from which nodes are randomly selected to be assigned to shards) size results in a higher failure probability, compromises network security and can lead to shard takeover attacks.</p>

</section>
<section id="cross-shard-communication">
<h5>Cross-Shard Communication<a class="headerlink" href="#cross-shard-communication" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h5>
<p>As the network gets divided into multiple shards, it is important to ensure that the shards can communicate with each other to maintain consistency and interoperability. As seen in [<a class="reference internal" href="#cross-sharding"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 7</span></a>], this can be problematic if there is forking within the shards and the block issuing the transaction is not included in the canonical chain. Both Near and Ethereum overcome this challenge by exchanging receipts between the shards. The receipts are used to prove that a transaction has been executed on a shard <span id="id10">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id68" title="Near. Near runtime spec. Near, 2020. URL: https://nomicon.io/RuntimeSpec/Receipts.">Nea20b</a>]</span> and the corresponding transaction can be executed on the other shard. In Hedera Hashgraph, which uses a gossip protocol to exchange information between shards, each shard maintains a queue of outgoing messages for other shards. Messages are sent from one shard to another through nodes randomly contacting each other, along with proof of consensus. The process continues until the receiving shard confirms message processing with an updated sequence number in its shared state <span id="id11">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id69" title="Hedera. Hedera hashgraph whitepaper. Hedera, 2020. URL: https://hedera.com/hh_whitepaper_v2.1-20200815.pdf.">Hed20</a>]</span>. Instead of receipts, Hedera uses sequence numbers which are maintained by a shard for each other shard as a proof of latest execution message.</p>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Sequence Numbers</strong></p>
<p>In the context of Hedera’s multi-shard system, sequence numbers are 64-bit identifiers assigned to inter-shard messages to keep track of their order. When a transaction involves resources from different shards, it triggers inter-shard messages. Each shard maintains a queue of outgoing messages to be sent to other shards, and each message within a specific queue is assigned a unique sequence number.</p>

<section id="data-availability">
<h5>Data Availability<a class="headerlink" href="#data-availability" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h5>
<p>The data availability problem relates to the difficulty of ensuring that all necessary data for verifying a block’s validity is accessible to all participants in the network. For instance, a light client cannot access complete block data and thus cannot
verify the validity of data. To overcome this problem, erasure coding is used. If the light client can retrieve a sufficient number of chunks of data, it can reconstruct the original data and verify the block’s validity. Ethereum and Near are currently using this approach.</p>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Erasure Codes</strong></p>
<p>Erasure codes allow a piece of data M chunks long to be expanded into a piece of data N chunks (“chunks” can be of arbitrary size), such that any M of the N chunks can be used to recover the original data.</p>

<h4>Sharding in Hedera<a class="headerlink" href="#sharding-in-hedera" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>As per Hedera network’s whitepaper <span id="id12">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id69" title="Hedera. Hedera hashgraph whitepaper. Hedera, 2020. URL: https://hedera.com/hh_whitepaper_v2.1-20200815.pdf.">Hed20</a>]</span>, it starts as a single shard composed of nodes managed by Governing Council Members. As the council grows, the network will transition to a multi-shard system to enhance performance, enable parallel consensus, and maintain asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance. Nodes will be randomly assigned to shards by a master shard, balancing hbar distribution and minimizing centralization risks. Shards will trust and collaborate, allowing seamless cross-shard transactions. Nodes will communicate via push messages, maintaining queues for inter-shard messaging. Transactions involving multiple shards will be consistently recorded in each shard’s state, ensuring ledger-wide coherence and integrity. The master shard will be responsible for maintaining the overall state of the network, including the hbar supply and the hbar distribution across shards.</p>

<section id="conclusion">
<h4>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Sharding is the most promising solution to overcome the scalability challenges of blockchain systems. However, although Ethereum and Near have made significant progress in implementing sharding, it is still not time-tested and it remains to be seen whether these blockchains will be able to bear a load of transactions volume when scenarios such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianakoffman/2020/08/31/defi-the-hot-new-crypto-trend-of-2020/?sh=5576a8a05bce">DeFi boom</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://qz.com/1145833/cryptokitties-is-causing-ethereum-network-congestion">NFT craze</a> happen again. Until then, layer 2 solutions such as ZK-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups will continue to be the preferred scaling solutions for blockchain systems.</p>

This has led to a rise in digital transactions and the need for a secure and reliable identity management system. SSI is emerging as a decentralised alternative to traditional centralised identity management systems, in which identities are cryptographically verifiable. It allows individuals to control their digital identities and share them with trusted parties. Each entity in the SSI system is identified by a unique DID (Decentralised Identifier) as shown below, which can be resolved to reveal information such as the entity’s public key and other metadata.</p>

<h4>Can SSI work without Blockchain?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-ssi-work-without-blockchain" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Blockchain is one of many options when implementing a Self-sovereign Identity system. Alternatives like IPFS, Public-key cryptography and even traditional Certificate Authorities can be used to implement SSI. However, the main advantage of using Blockchain is that it provides a decentralised and immutable ledger that can be used to store and verify credentials.</p>

<p>Self-sovereign identity can potentially revolutionise various industries, including healthcare, voting systems and many more. However, as research and development in SSI progress, it will be
crucial to address interoperability, scalability, and usability challenges to realise SSI’s potential in a global context fully.</p>

<h4>2. <strong>Definition and Importance of Cross-Chain Interoperability</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#definition-and-importance-of-cross-chain-interoperability" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Cross-chain interoperability</strong> can be defined as the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate, share data, and transact with one another without relying on centralized intermediaries. In simpler terms, it’s the bridge that allows one blockchain to “talk” to another.</p>
<p>But why is this so crucial?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Maximized Efficiency</strong>: Interoperability allows for the pooling of resources and functionalities from various chains, leading to more efficient and powerful applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced Liquidity</strong>: Assets can move freely across chains, creating a more fluid and interconnected financial ecosystem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Broader Adoption</strong>: A unified blockchain ecosystem can be more easily adopted by traditional sectors, as it offers a comprehensive set of solutions without the limitations of individual chains.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>3. <strong>The Landscape of Blockchain Networks</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#the-landscape-of-blockchain-networks" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The current blockchain landscape is a testament to the innovative spirit of the crypto community. Let’s delve into some major players:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Ethereum</strong>: Often dubbed the “world computer”, Ethereum introduced the world to smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. It has since become the go-to platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Binance Smart Chain (BSC)</strong>: BSC offers a faster and more scalable alternative to Ethereum, with shorter block times and lower transaction fees. It has attracted a significant number of DeFi projects and users, especially during periods of network congestion on Ethereum.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cardano</strong>: With a research-driven approach, Cardano emphasizes sustainability, scalability, and transparency. It’s built on a unique “Ouroboros” proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and promises more efficient smart contract execution.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While each of these networks (and many others) offers unique features and strengths, they operate in isolation. The lack of a common language or protocol for these chains to communicate poses challenges, especially for applications that could benefit from features spread across multiple chains.</p>
</section>
<section id="mechanisms-and-methods-for-interoperability">
<h4>4. <strong>Mechanisms and Methods for Interoperability</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#mechanisms-and-methods-for-interoperability" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The quest for seamless communication between blockchains has led to the development of various mechanisms and methods. Here’s a closer look:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Bridges</strong>: These are protocols designed to facilitate communication between two blockchains, allowing for the transfer of tokens and data. For instance, the “Wrapped Bitcoin” (wBTC) on Ethereum is a representation of Bitcoin, made possible through a bridge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relay Chains and Parachains</strong>: Popularized by Polkadot, this model uses a central relay chain to which multiple parachains (individual blockchains) connect. The relay chain is responsible for the network’s shared security, consensus, and cross-chain interoperability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hub-and-Spoke</strong>: Cosmos employs this model, where the central Cosmos Hub connects to various blockchains (termed zones). The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol facilitates the communication between the hub and its zones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oracles</strong>: While primarily known for feeding external data to blockchains, oracles like Chainlink can also serve as data bridges between chains, allowing smart contracts on one blockchain to receive data from another.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wrapped Tokens</strong>: These are tokens from one blockchain represented on another. For example, wBTC on Ethereum represents Bitcoin, allowing BTC to be used within Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interledger Protocols</strong>: These aim to create a standardized protocol for payments across chains, ensuring seamless asset transfers.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="leading-innovators-in-interoperability">
<h4>5. <strong>Leading Innovators in Interoperability</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#leading-innovators-in-interoperability" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Several trailblazing projects are at the forefront of cross-chain solutions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Polkadot</strong>: Spearheaded by Dr. Gavin Wood, one of Ethereum’s co-founders, Polkadot focuses on enabling different blockchains to transfer messages and value in a trust-free fashion. Its relay chain and parachain model is a novel approach to scalability and interoperability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cosmos</strong>: With its vision of an “Internet of Blockchains”, Cosmos aims to create a network of blockchains able to communicate with one another. Its IBC protocol is a significant step towards achieving this vision.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chainlink</strong>: Beyond its primary role as a decentralized oracle network, Chainlink is vital for cross-chain data sharing, ensuring that smart contracts on one chain can access data from another.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="challenges-in-achieving-interoperability">
<h4>6. <strong>Challenges in Achieving Interoperability</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#challenges-in-achieving-interoperability" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>While the promise of cross-chain interoperability is tantalizing, the journey is riddled with challenges:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Security Concerns</strong>: As assets move between chains, ensuring their security becomes paramount. The bridge or protocol facilitating the transfer must be foolproof to prevent potential exploits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Standardization</strong>: With a plethora of blockchains, each with its architecture and consensus mechanism, developing a universal standard for communication is daunting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: As interoperability solutions gain traction, the volume of cross-chain transactions will surge. Handling this increased traffic without causing congestion is a significant challenge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Economic Models</strong>: Harmonizing the varying fee structures, staking mechanisms, and incentive models of different blockchains is a complex task.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="potential-solutions-to-challenges">
<h4>7. <strong>Potential Solutions to Challenges</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#potential-solutions-to-challenges" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The challenges of cross-chain interoperability, while significant, are not insurmountable. Innovators in the space are already devising solutions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Layer 2 Solutions</strong>: By moving some operations off the main blockchain (Layer 1) and onto a secondary layer, Layer 2 solutions can significantly increase transaction throughput and reduce fees. Examples include Ethereum’s Rollups and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Off-chain Computations</strong>: By performing certain operations off-chain and only recording the final state on-chain, it’s possible to achieve higher efficiency without compromising security.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sharding</strong>: This involves splitting a blockchain into multiple smaller chains (shards) that run concurrently. Each shard handles a fraction of the network’s transactions, leading to increased scalability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Witnesses and Validators</strong>: To ensure security during cross-chain operations, a set of nodes (witnesses or validators) can be used to monitor and validate transactions. Their consensus can help prevent malicious activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protocols for Standardization</strong>: Initiatives like the Interledger Protocol aim to create a standardized protocol for payments across chains, ensuring seamless asset transfers.</p></li>

<h4>Challenges in Scam Detection on Ethereum<a class="headerlink" href="#challenges-in-scam-detection-on-ethereum" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>There are three main challenges to be addressed in scam detection on Ethereum :</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>How to systematically analyze scams:</strong> Different types of scams may employ different methods and strategies, targeting different victims. Therefore, researchers need to collect and analyze a large amount of fraud case data to gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics and patterns of fraudulent behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How to extract effective features:</strong> The performance of scam detection is closely related to the choice of extracted features. Since fraudulent behavior may exhibit subtle differences from normal behavior, it is necessary to select discriminative features to distinguish between the two.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How to timely detect scams:</strong> Detecting scams timely is crucial to minimize losses and prevent more ordinary investors from falling victim to fraud. When scams are identified or predicted early, authorities and exchanges can take appropriate actions to freeze suspicious accounts and block fraudulent transactions.</p></li>

Transaction information is very critical but cannot be captured by general random walk-based network embedding methods. Therefore, they proposed a novel network embedding algorithm called trans2vec to extract the features for subsequent phishing identification by taking the transaction amount and timestamp into consideration. They also assumed that a larger amount of value of the transaction implies a closer relationship between accounts and the later the transaction is, the greater the impact on the current relationship of the accounts.</p>
<p>New means of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) phishing scams have emerged in the Ethereum ecosystem with the popularity of NFTs. Previous research lacks a systematic review and retrospective analysis of NFT phishing scams.

<h4>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Gossip about gossip</strong></p>
<p>The “Gossip about Gossip” protocol is a fundamental part of the consensus algorithm, which disseminates transactions across network nodes through random information exchange, similar to social gossip. Beyond transaction data, this protocol also conveys the timeline and pathway of data propagation, enabling an efficient consensus on transaction order without a laborious proof-of-work process.</p>
</aside>
<!-- = Briefly introduce Hedera, its mission, and its unique features. -->
<p>Hedera is a distributed ledger technology designed to offer a secure, fair, and fast platform for a new generation of real-time applications and services <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id122" title="LLC Hedera Hashgraph. Understanding decentralization of hedera hashgraph. Technical Report, Hedera Hashgraph, LLC, 3 2023. Technical Report, Version 1. URL: https://files.hedera.com/hh-decentralization-of-consensus.pdf.">HH23</a>]</span>. In the Hedera network, a user initiates a transaction, which is then quickly disseminated among nodes through an efficient “gossip” protocol. Nodes gossip messages to each other about transactions randomly. Consensus on transactions is achieved independently by nodes using a virtual voting algorithm, which calculates a consensus timestamp based on the median timestamp when the majority of nodes received the transaction. This mechanism ensures transaction fairness and security, as no single node can significantly manipulate the order, thereby providing resilience against malicious activities.</p>
<p>The transaction recording process using Hedera and its benefits can be seen in <a class="reference internal" href="#hed-diagram"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 11</span></a>.</p>

<p>Since Hedera launched in August 2018, it offers unique transactional capabilities through its native HBAR cryptocurrency, used both for network security and as fuel for network services. As a proof-of-stake network, HBARs help safeguard the network by representing voting power; thus, wider distribution of HBARs prevents potential attacks by making it prohibitively expensive for a malicious entity to control one-third of the coins. In addition, HBARs serve as fuel for network services, compensating nodes for providing computing resources, and ensuring low, stable transaction fees. For example, a cryptocurrency transfer currently costs $0.0001 (paid in HBARs) <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id123" title="Leemon Baird, Bryan Gross, and Donald Thibeau.

<h4>Hedera Cryptocurrency Service<a class="headerlink" href="#hedera-cryptocurrency-service" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Hedera provides two distinct services related to digital assets: the Hedera Cryptocurrency Service and Token Service. The Cryptocurrency Service pertains specifically to the use of HBAR for transactions and fees on the network, while the Token Service provides a platform for users to create and manage their own custom tokens. Hedera’s cryptocurrency is engineered for speed, resulting in minimal network fees and enabling feasible micro-transactions. When Hedera is fully operational, every user will have the capability to manage a network node and receive cryptocurrency payments for this contribution. To create an account, all that is needed is to generate a key pair; there is no need for a linked name or address. However, users are given the flexibility to link hashes of identity credentials from any selected third-party certificate or identity authority. This function is purposefully constructed to aid in adhering to legal standards in regions enforcing Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. Further details can be found in the Regulatory Compliance section <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id128" title="Leemon Baird, Mance Harmon, and Paul Madsen.

<h4>Hedera Consensus Service<a class="headerlink" href="#hedera-consensus-service" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) is an essential component of the Hedera network that provides a decentralised, secure, and verifiable log of events. It facilitates agreement on transaction order and timing across diverse applications, ranging from supply chains to multiplayer gaming. More than just a transactional ledger, HCS revolutionises the blockchain ecosystem by offering swift, fair, and decentralised consensus. Utilising the hashgraph consensus algorithm, HCS expedites transaction settlements, fostering transparency with a timestamped process. It not only bolsters efficiency and the trust model of private networks but also significantly reduces operational costs. Moreover, it promotes a collaborative environment for interconnected applications, paving the way for the next wave of decentralised applications<span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id123" title="Leemon Baird, Bryan Gross, and Donald Thibeau. Hedera consensus service. Technical Report, Hedera Hashgraph, 2019. Technical Whitepaper. URL: https://hedera.com/hh-consensus-service-whitepaper.pdf.">BGT19</a>]</span>.</p>
<section id="hcs-architecture-and-configuration">
<h5>HCS Architecture and Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#hcs-architecture-and-configuration" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h5>
<p>HCS is made accessible through various SDKs and the Hedera API (HAPI). It processes byte string messages from client applications tied to unique topics. These messages, carrying transactional details, are processed against a fee in HBARs, Hedera’s native currency. Upon successful processing, the Hedera ledger returns a record with consensus details, timestamps, sequence numbers, and running hashes reflecting previous messages. To configure this service, organisations set up mirror nodes, program applications, and define unique keys and topics for transactions to configure HCS. After verification and confirmation of the transaction fee payment, the transaction information is disseminated across the network to establish a consensus timestamp. Mirror nodes receive this information, facilitating the creation of state proofs and further transaction processing. This configuration ensures robust record distribution and real-time auditing, fostering transparency and immediate validation of transaction order and accuracy.</p>

A unique feature is the provision of proof-of-deletion, allowing businesses to comply with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) requirements. Files in the system have a set expiration date and are deleted automatically, while the storage service costs are based on the file size and the desired storage duration. Furthermore, Hedera offers controlled mutability via WACL (WriteAccess Control) keys, providing flexible data management and ensuring consensus for any changes. Transactions on Hedera are limited to 4KB, ensuring efficiency, although larger files can be accommodated through the appending of additional data. The service supports various transactions including creating, appending, deleting, and updating files, offering comprehensive and flexible options for developers and users. In essence, Hedera’s File Service is a robust, secure, and efficient solution for decentralised data storage, embodying the low-cost and high-performance advantages of the platform <span id="id9">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id127" title="Evelyn Wong.

<h4>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, with its innovative models and frameworks, has introduced disruptive business models that challenge the traditional financial landscape. This article aims to analyze this challenge in detail, exploring how traditional players in finance can leverage the hidden and visible value within DeFi business models. To enhance your understanding of this topic and to provide you with a better understanding of this article, I recommend reviewing the following articles “<em>Short Survey on Business Models of Decentralized Finance</em>” by Jiahua Xu and Teng Andrea Xu and “<em>DeFi vs TradFi: Valuation Using Multiples and Discounted Cash Flow</em>” by Teng Andrea Xu, Jiahua Xu, Kristof Lommers.</p>

<section id="business-ideas">
<h4>Business Ideas<a class="headerlink" href="#business-ideas" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Let’s begin with a foundational overview, drawing insights from the aforementioned articles.</p>
<p>Within the context of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Business Models among the prominent DeFi business models are Protocols for Loanable Funds (PLFs), Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), and Yield Aggregators. This section will delve into these DeFi models and discuss their potential adoption by traditional insurance companies and banks. Any additional details not covered in this article can be further explored in the aforementioned articles.</p>
<p><strong>a) Protocols for Loanable Funds (PLFs)</strong>:</p>
<p>PLFs have revolutionized lending and borrowing within the financial sector. These protocols facilitate access to loans and cryptocurrency lending without intermediaries. Revenues are generated through interest rates, shared between the protocols and lenders.</p>
<p><strong>b) Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</strong>:</p>
<p>DEXs enable peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading, eliminating the need for intermediaries. These platforms earn revenue by charging trading fees, contributing to the protocol’s treasury.</p>
<p><strong>c) Yield Aggregators</strong>:</p>
<p>Yield Aggregators merge strategies to optimize investor returns. Investors deposit funds into “Vaults,” implementing diverse strategies for profitability. Yield Aggregators levy commission fees on strategy profits.</p>

<section id="resolving-the-paradox">
<h4>Resolving the Paradox<a class="headerlink" href="#resolving-the-paradox" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The question arises: Is it paradoxical for traditional insurance companies and banks, champions of centralized finance, to embrace DeFi models to extract additional value while upholding their established positions? However, as the financial landscape evolves, exploring innovative opportunities becomes essential to maintain profitability and stay ahead in the highly competitive and regulated financial sector. To be noted that profits in the financial industry are significantly influenced by Central Bank decisions, particularly interest rate fluctuations. <strong>By adopting decentralized finance business models, though seemingly paradoxical at first glance, financial institutions can stabilize revenues and partially free themselves from Central Bank decisions.</strong> With this context in mind, let’s explore potential business opportunities and risks for traditional banks and insurance companies in adopting each DeFi business model.</p>
<p><strong>a) PLFs</strong>：</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Business Opportunities for Traditional Banks</strong>：</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Penetrating a New Market: Through PLFs, banks can tap into the burgeoning cryptocurrency lending market, attracting a fresh customer base. The emphasis, in reality, must be on cross-selling and upselling commercial opportunities, rather than immediate profits.</p></li>
<li><p>Diversified Revenues: PLFs provide an additional revenue stream, complementing traditional lending practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Technological Innovation: Legacy IT systems in banks are challenging to overhaul. PLFs, with their innovative technology, could serve as pilot systems, gradually expanding across the organization.</p></li>

As technology advances and the digital economy expands, it is crucial for banks (to be more specific: legacy and traditional banks) to understand and effectively manage the risks associated with these assets. These risks are generated and linked from the following drivers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the volatile nature and intrinsic features of digital assets and cryptos</p></li>
<li><p>customers that trade and hold these specific assets</p></li>
<li><p>as-is organizational frameworks related to risk management and best practices that did not consider cryptocurrencies and digital assets</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The objective of this article is twofold: on one hand to provide a review of the main financial and non-financial risks arising from the management of non-standard products for traditional banks; on the other hand, to identify the key value drivers within risk management to uncover new best practices and new business opportunities.</p>
<p>To achieve these two objectives, the pros and cons of each risk will be emphasized.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the article, the risks that can raise greater concern and those that can be harnessed as catalysts to amplify innovation, both technologically and financially, will become clear.</p>

<h4>Managing Risks<a class="headerlink" href="#managing-risks" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Let us begin with an examination of the various pros related to holding and trading cryptocurrencies for legacy Banks:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Diversification and Portfolio Expansion</strong>:
Cryptocurrencies and digital assets offer banks the potential for diversifying their portfolios beyond traditional financial instruments. This can enhance risk-adjusted returns and provide exposure to new markets and investment opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Client Demand and Engagement</strong>:<br />
Banks that offer cryptocurrency services can attract and retain more clients seeking exposure to digital assets. Meeting this demand can lead to increased customer engagement and revenue generation (i.e., new revenue streams). Let’s look for example at Revolut Ltd. case <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id150" title="Revolut Ltd. Annual report and financial statements. Dec. 2021. URL: https://assets.revolut.com/pdf/Revolut_Ltd_YE_2021_Annual%20Report.pdf.">Ltd21</a>]</span>. As widely acknowledged, Revolut stands as one of the most accomplished digital banks, providing customers with an array of services encompassing crypto services, traditional banking features, and various other financial offerings. The Financial Statements of Revolut Ltd. communicate that the company succeeded in drawing a substantial customer base by utilizing a comprehensive financial package, with its cryptocurrency services taking the spotlight. Moreover, Revolut’s strong suit lies in its ability to enable many individuals to manage cryptocurrencies without encountering technicalities or complexities associated with handling the private keys of digital assets. All these concepts are derived from Revolut’s main financials <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id150" title="Revolut Ltd. Annual report and financial statements. Dec. 2021. URL: https://assets.revolut.com/pdf/Revolut_Ltd_YE_2021_Annual%20Report.pdf.">Ltd21</a>]</span> and Revolut case, as depicted in the table below, Revolut’s growth rate is remarkable, encompassing both its customer base and revenues. <strong>This underscores the hidden value that legacy banks can uncover and harness by integrating cryptocurrency and digital asset services into their existing offerings.</strong></p></li>

Banks need to consider the potential impact of interest rate fluctuations on the valuation of cryptocurrencies, especially if they hold these assets on their balance sheets. It’s important to recognize that the relationship between interest rates and cryptocurrencies is complex and influenced by numerous factors, including absolute value of interests, market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id146" title="Duggan，Wayne and Powell，Farran.

Managing crypto investment risks. Jun. 2023. URL: https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/articles/nav/investing/crypto-risk.">Tan23</a>]</span>. Banks need to carefully assess and monitor these dynamics to effectively manage the interest rate risk associated with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the <strong>Interest Rate Increase</strong> scenario:</p>
<p>If interest rates rise, they can have several implications for cryptocurrencies held by banks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Valuation Impact</strong>: cryptocurrencies, like other investment assets, may experience a decline in value when interest rates increase. This valuation impact can affect the overall profitability of the bank’s investment portfolio.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Opportunity Cost</strong>: Rising interest rates can make traditional fixed-income investments more attractive, potentially diverting investment capital away from cryptocurrencies. This could lead to a reduced allocation to cryptocurrencies within the bank’s portfolio.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely, if <strong>interest rates decrease</strong>, they can also affect cryptocurrencies in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Valuation Impact</strong>: cryptocurrencies may experience increased demand when interest rates decline, leading to potential price appreciation. However, it is important to note that cryptocurrencies are influenced by various other factors, and interest rates alone may not be the sole driver of their valuation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investment Attractiveness</strong>: lower interest rates can make cryptocurrencies relatively more attractive compared to traditional fixed-income investments that provide lower yields. Banks may consider increasing their exposure to cryptocurrencies as part of their investment strategy during periods of low interest rates.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, it’s worth noting that interest rate risk related to cryptocurrencies primarily arises when they are held as investment assets on a bank’s balance sheet. If cryptocurrencies are held for other purposes, such as providing custody <span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id147" title="Custodial vs non-custodial wallets. Feb. 2023. URL: https://crypto.com/university/custodial-vs-non-custodial-wallets.">20223</a>]</span>or trading services, the interest rate risk may be less relevant. As with any investment asset, banks should have appropriate risk management policies and frameworks in place to assess and monitor interest rate risk associated with cryptocurrencies. This may involve stress testing, scenario analysis, and regular reviews to ensure the bank’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations aligns with its risk appetite and strategic objectives.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Currency Risk</strong>: Cryptocurrencies are not tied to any specific fiat currency, so it is possible to infer that no idiosyncratic currency risk is in place.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hedging Risks</strong> <span id="id8">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id149" title="Lynette Tan. Managing crypto investment risks. Jun. 2023. URL: https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/articles/nav/investing/crypto-risk.">Tan23</a>]</span>: here, hedging risks have two financial legs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The first one is related to the protection against volatility related to customer digital assets portfolios (that can be seen as a commercial opportunity for legacy banks)</p></li>
<li><p>The second one is related to the protection of the legacy bank itself against volatility. Please note that cryptocurrency derivatives (or more in general, digital assets derivatives) and hedging instruments are emerging, providing opportunities, and related risks, for banks to hedge their exposure to price volatility and mitigate associated risks.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Liquidity Risks</strong> <span id="id9">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id149" title="Lynette Tan. Managing crypto investment risks. Jun. 2023. URL: https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/articles/nav/investing/crypto-risk.">Tan23</a>]</span>: cryptocurrency markets can experience liquidity challenges, especially during periods of market stress. Banks should carefully assess liquidity ratios and availability (to be more specific also in the interbank and monetary market) when holding and trading these assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Climate &amp; Environmental Risks</strong>: banks, especially in the European Union, have targets (such as Net Zero Banking Alliance) on their own greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and financed emissions (GHG emissions produced by banks’ customers). This topic is very relevant because financing crypto customers could result in increasing GHG financed emissions. Since some cryptocurrency assets/digital assets are very energy-intensive assets (e.g., due to mining), the main challenge is how to make a fruitful cherry-picking of digital and crypto assets that at the same time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>rely on the most efficient technology (hence, they emit less with respect to the market)</p></li>
<li><p>guarantee the most profitable income for legacy banks and customers, given the GHG emissions target</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Reputational Risks</strong>: Reputational risks can emerge while managing cryptocurrencies and crypto customers, stemming from regulatory scrutiny as well as media and public perception surrounding these assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ICT Risks</strong> <span id="id10">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id148" title="Andrey Sergeenkov. How to manage risk when trading cryptocurrency. May 2023. URL: https://www.coindesk.com/learn/how-to-manage-risk-when-trading-cryptocurrency/.">Ser23</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#id149" title="Lynette Tan. Managing crypto investment risks. Jun. 2023. URL: https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/articles/nav/investing/crypto-risk.">Tan23</a>]</span>: Information and Communication Technology (ICT) risks refer to the potential risks associated with the use of technology, information systems, and infrastructure within an organization. In the context of cryptocurrencies and digital assets, ICT risk could be the paramount one, and can manifest in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Security of Digital Wallets and Exchanges</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unauthorized Access: Cryptocurrency wallets (provided by legacy banks) can be vulnerable to unauthorized access, leading to (personal) data theft or loss of digital assets. Risks include hacking attempts, phishing attacks, or malware targeting the storage or transfer mechanisms of cryptocurrencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Infrastructure Vulnerabilities: Weaknesses in ICT infrastructure, such as servers, networks, or software, can expose digital wallets to potential security breaches. Vulnerabilities in infrastructure may arise due to outdated systems, inadequate security measures, or insufficient monitoring and patching practices.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Data Integrity and Availability</strong>: No specific issues coming from these topics.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cyber Risks</strong> <span id="id11">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id148" title="Andrey Sergeenkov. How to manage risk when trading cryptocurrency. May 2023. URL: https://www.coindesk.com/learn/how-to-manage-risk-when-trading-cryptocurrency/.">Ser23</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#id149" title="Lynette Tan. Managing crypto investment risks. Jun. 2023. URL: https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/articles/nav/investing/crypto-risk.">Tan23</a>]</span>: Cyber risks refer to the potential risks arising from malicious activities. In the context of cryptocurrencies and digital assets, cyber risks can include, inter alia:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Phishing and Social Engineering</strong>: Cybercriminals may attempt to deceive individuals within the bank or its clients into revealing sensitive information, such as private keys or login credentials, through phishing emails, fake websites, or social engineering techniques.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Malware and Ransomware Attacks</strong>: Malicious software can be used to target digital wallets, exchanges, or users, aiming to gain unauthorized access, steal funds, or encrypt data for ransom. Ransomware attacks can disrupt operations and cause financial losses if not adequately mitigated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insider Threats</strong>: Internal personnel with access to sensitive information or systems can intentionally or unintentionally misuse or compromise digital assets.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Operational Risks</strong>: There are no specific or innovative aspects in terms of Operational Risks. All Operational Risks are interconnected and integrated within the Cyber Risk realm. Therefore, there’s no necessity to extensively explore this topic.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As evident from the text above, ICT Risks and Cyber Risks pose the most significant threats that legacy banks must face, and these could even lead to potential reputational risks in the event of their occurrence. These two areas require the most substantial efforts in terms of financial IT investment, skilled human resources, and new organization framework by the legacy banks. They must undertake considerable technological advancements to enter the realm of cryptocurrency business.</p>

<h4>Main results<a class="headerlink" href="#main-results" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The objective of this article, as previously mentioned, was two-fold: firstly, to provide an overview of the main financial and non-financial risks arising from managing non-standard products for traditional banks, such as cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Secondly, to pinpoint the key value drivers within risk management to uncover novel best practices and innovative business opportunities. The primary advantage of the guidelines outlined in the main section of this article is the following: to manage cryptocurrencies and digital assets, banks must introduce an additional variable, in other words, an additional complexity layer, into their organizational framework, and to be more specific within their risk management models. This complexity translates into both a negative aspect, which can be represented as increased costs to manage this new layer of complexity, and a positive aspect: skillful management of this complexity could transform legacy institutions into innovative ones, securing additional profits and competitive advantages that are rare and hard to replicate within the financial industry <span id="id12">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id147" title="Custodial vs non-custodial wallets.

<p>Furthermore, the legacy bank that first adopts this new analytical variable into its risk management model (and therefore, also into its business approach) can enjoy the benefits of being a first mover.</p>
<p>Eventually, the following key takeaways emerge:
1. Banks can benefit from engaging with cryptocurrencies through diversification, attracting clients, and fostering innovation (let’s look for example at the Revolut case, highlighted in this article).
2. Effective, proactive, and reactive risk management practices are crucial to mitigate traditional risks (e.g., interest rate risk) in the context of cryptocurrencies.
3. Liquidity risks in cryptocurrency markets require careful consideration and contingency planning.
4. Proactive monitoring, robust internal controls, and compliance with regulations are essential for banks to manage risks effectively.</p>

<p>Web3, short for Web 3.0, is the third generation of internet services for websites and applications that incorporate blockchain-based and decentralised processes. It emphasises a user-centric online experience where data ownership and control is returned to the individual, as opposed to being centralised in large tech companies.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>DAOs</strong></p>
<p>A Decentralised Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a blockchain-based system governed by rules encoded as computer programmes known as smart contracts, with decision-making authority distributed among its members.</p>
</aside>
<p>Web3 has largely been anonymous for its users, due to its founding principles, which are deeply rooted in privacy and decentralisation. However, the lack of ability to confirm individual identities, their properties, and affiliations has posed a challenge for blockchain adoption in some industries. Soulbound tokens (SBTs) are set to bridge this identity gap inherent in Web3, facilitating the formation of trusted relationships. Soulbound tokens can be issued by any entity, be it DAOs, academic institutions, DeFi firms, or employers, to denote membership, authentication or certification, or event participation. Moreover, soulbound tokens can utilise these links between individuals and various entities to provide a more comprehensive picture of distinct user identities and their roots. The reputation of the issuing entity is transferred via SBTs to the wallets or individuals who hold them. The more prestigious the issuing body, the higher the standing of the individual in possession of a soulbound token.</p>
<p>As an individual’s connections with different entities grow, so does their unique identity and reputation. Soulbound tokens capitalise on this network of connections to construct verifiable identities for souls. NFTs will serve as proof of ownership, and SBTs as proof of character <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id80" title="Tomer Jordi Chaffer and Justin Goldston.

<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Sybil Attack</strong></p>
<p>A Sybil attack is a type of security threat in decentralised networks where a single entity creates multiple fake identities (Sybils) to gain undue influence or control. These attacks can disrupt the functioning of the network by undermining consensus mechanisms.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Collusion Attack</strong></p>
<p>A collusion attack in blockchain refers to a scenario where a group of participants in a network conspire together to manipulate the system for their own advantage. This can happen in proof-of-stake or proof-of-work blockchain systems where enough nodes, typically over 50%, are controlled by a colluding group. This allows them to control the validation of transactions, potentially allowing them to double-spend, block transactions, or manipulate the blockchain in other ways. This is often referred to as a 51% attack.</p>

It is built on trust and cooperation while also correcting for biases and tendencies to overcoordinate.</p>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Vampire Attack</strong></p>
<p>In the context of decentralised finance (DeFi) and blockchain, a vampire attack is a strategy where a new protocol aims to drain liquidity and users from an existing one. This is often done by offering higher rewards or better incentives on the new platform, incentivizing users of the old platform to migrate their assets.</p>
</aside>
<p>Economic growth is primarily driven by networks yielding increasing returns, but the current private property paradigm of DeFi can limit such growth. DeSoc recommends treating networks as partially and collectively shared goods, applying governance mechanisms that balance trust and cooperation, while checking for collusion and capture. This model supports a bottom-up approach in building, participating in, and governing networks. Consequently, it creates structures resilient to Sybil and vampire attacks and collusion, and promotes plural networks that provide widespread benefits, agreed upon by diverse members.</p>
<p>The strength of DeSoc lies in fostering broader cooperation by encouraging the creation and intersection of nested networks across the physical and digital realms. Building on trust, it allows for the establishment of resilient plural network goods. This approach enables Web3 to resist short-term financialization and cultivate a future with increasing returns across diverse social connections.</p>

<p><strong>Differences between soulbound tokens (SBTs) and regular non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">

<h4>Functionality of SBTs<a class="headerlink" href="#functionality-of-sbts" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>A distinct and pivotal characteristic of Soulbound tokens (SBTs) is their inherent non-transferability. Unlike existing NFTs and token standards like the fungible ERC-20 or non-fungible ERC-721, which are built to hold market value and can be sold or transferred between wallets, SBTs are uniquely tied to Souls and therefore are not designed for selling or transferring <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id90" title="Akash Takyar. What are soulbound tokens, and how do they work? LeewayHertz, 2023. URL: https://www.leewayhertz.com/soulbound-tokens/.">Tak23</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>SBTs are issued and held within unique accounts known as Souls, which serve as a vessel for these tokens and play a crucial role in establishing provenance and reputation. Souls can denote various entities, ranging from individuals to organisations, companies, and more. It’s noteworthy that in a decentralised society (DeSoc), Souls are not required to have a direct human equivalence, meaning a single person can be associated with multiple Souls. Unlike regular NFTs, soulbound tokens (SBTs) are a concept of non-transferable assets <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id91" title="Olusegun Joel Titus.

<h4>Potential Applications of SBTs<a class="headerlink" href="#potential-applications-of-sbts" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) are a revolutionary concept in the realm of blockchain technology, enabling the creation of verifiable, non-transferable digital records tied to an individual’s identity or “soul”. With their immutable and decentralised characteristics, these tokens offer several potential applications that span numerous industries and societal structures. From authenticating factual records, devising digital inheritance plans, and facilitating alternative credit systems to preventing Sybil attacks in Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), enhancing trust in online property rentals, and securing the management of healthcare records, SBTs are primed to reshape the digital world. The following sections detail some of the most promising applications of Soulbound Tokens in diverse fields.</p>
<section id="verifying-authenticity-of-factual-records">
<h5>Verifying Authenticity of Factual Records<a class="headerlink" href="#verifying-authenticity-of-factual-records" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h5>
<p>Soulbound Tokens can be used to confirm the authenticity of supposed factual records, such as photos and videos. As deep fake technology continues to advance, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for both humans and algorithms to determine the truth through direct examination. While blockchain inclusion enables us to trace the time a particular work was made, SBTs would enable us to trace the social provenance, giving us rich social context to the Soul that issued the work, their constellation of memberships, aliations, credentials and their social distance to the subject <span id="id8">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id86" title="E Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, and Vitalik Buterin.

<section id="alternative-credit-systems">
<h5>Alternative Credit Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#alternative-credit-systems" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h5>
<p>An ecosystem of Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) could provide an alternative to traditional credit systems, using education credentials, work history, and rental contracts to build a credit history. Non-transferable SBTs representing loans could be used as non-seizable reputation-based collateral. The system would prevent loan evasion and promote transparency in lending markets, reducing reliance on centralised credit-scoring. Ultimately, this could enhance lending algorithms and facilitate lending within social networks <span id="id10">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id86" title="E Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, and Vitalik Buterin.

<h5>Enhancing Trust in Online Property Rental<a class="headerlink" href="#enhancing-trust-in-online-property-rental" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h5>
<p>The economic growth potential of the real estate sector is significant, encompassing diverse industries from retail to housing services. The digitization of real estate, however, has invited several challenges, notably in the form of scams targeting landlords and tenants. To address this issue, a blockchain-based property rental platform is proposed. This platform will utilise Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) to verify the credibility and reputation of users, providing security against online rental fraud. A non-transferable, non-fungible token is provided to the new user that records their reputation across their time on the website. Property listings will be structured as smart contracts on the platform, ensuring secure and immutable transaction terms between landlords and tenants. This could drastically reduce fraud, enhance trust, and potentially transform the online rental industry <span id="id12">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id83" title="Sanskar Sharma, Aryan Kumar, Nidhi Sengar, and Ajay Kumar Kaushik.

These tokens, earned through completing tasks, safeguard against system manipulation such as whitewashing or Sybil attacks. Additionally, the tokens represent an arbitrator’s decision-making accuracy, not their financial capacity. Arbitrators may need to provide credentials like licences or certificates, along with proof of identity. This data would be presented to a decentralised committee, which upon verification, associates a long-term secret key with the arbitrator’s identity and the soulbound token, ensuring transparency and confidentiality <span id="id13">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id85" title="Ece Su Ustun and Melek Yuce.

<h5>Secure Management of Healthcare Records<a class="headerlink" href="#secure-management-of-healthcare-records" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h5>
<p>In a patient-centric soulbound NFT framework for electronic health records (EHRs) to prevent the unauthorised trading of important medical documents, Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) can be employed. These tokens can’t be bought or transferred; once assigned, they remain tethered to your private wallet and identity. As such, they’re ideal for digitising non-transferable aspects like qualifications, reputation, and healthcare records. The ownership of the token bestows the right to control access to the information it contains, including the ability to revoke that access when required. Instead of being stored in a centralised database, personal information is managed in a blockchain-enabled format, providing enhanced access and control to the token’s owner <span id="id16">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id84" title="Namrta Tanwar and Jawahar Thakur.

<h4>Challenges and Concerns<a class="headerlink" href="#challenges-and-concerns" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), as an emerging concept, come with several challenges. Some of the notable concerns include <span id="id18">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id88" title="Juan Leal. What are soulbound tokens? thirdweb, 2022.

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Privacy:</strong> As SBTs are linked to a specific individual, they could potentially be used for tracking and monitoring that individual’s online activities. Technological advancements like zero-knowledge proofs on the blockchain could help address these privacy concerns by providing improved anonymity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security:</strong> If a user’s non-custodial wallet is compromised, malicious entities could misuse the SBTs, particularly those providing exclusive access or governance rights. This could harm the user and the communities they’re associated with. This issue can be mitigated by storing assets in secure custodial wallets or vaults.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Like many NFTs, SBTs are often minted on specific blockchains, which can restrict their versatility and applicability beyond their native chain. This limitation can be partially addressed by integrating EVM-compatible chains into prevalent Web3 applications and ensuring most users stay within a single blockchain ecosystem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-transferability:</strong> The non-transferable nature of SBTs, while offering numerous benefits, can also pose challenges. If a token is unwillingly assigned to someone, it may lead to issues. This can be resolved by developing more robust permissioned interfaces on top of the blockchain, allowing users to enjoy the benefits of SBTs while also having the option to conceal or remove SBTs from their profile.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure wider adoption and success, these issues associated with SBTs need to be ironed out. Although souls can choose to hide what SBTs reveal, in a way, they could also foster discrimination by revealing too many details in specific situations or contexts. This is particularly true for marginalized social groups who are more likely to experience disfavor <span id="id19">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id87" title="Shrishti.Eth.

With the right solutions, non-transferable NFTs like SBTs have the potential to contribute to a more equitable and privacy-focused digital society.</p>

<section id="conclusion">
<h4>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>In the quest to build a decentralised society, or DeSoc, Soulbound tokens (SBTs) serve as fundamental components. By creating a solid digital identity and provenance, they play an instrumental role in the growth of this new societal structure. The idea of a decentralised society might seem theoretical or abstract, yet it has numerous practical implications that are worth contemplating.</p>
<p>Soulbound tokens, in their diverse and wide-ranging applications, span the spectrum from web3 and DeFi to facets of everyday life. They are a rapidly emerging trend, destined not only to significantly influence the Web3 ecosystem but also to elevate the perception of NFTs. Rather than being seen merely as a means of owning artwork or symbols of prestige, NFTs can function as pivotal tools in the creation and confirmation of digital identities and connections in a decentralised world.</p>
